TODO
----

* deal with default: [], probably by marshall dumping and loading
* rspec matchers need to be able to talk about nouns and predicates
* .with() <-- no args, what should error messages be?
* substitutability
* add methods for substitutability


Features for future vuersions
-----------------------------

* arity option
* support for raising errors
* need some way to talk about and record blocks being passed
* support all rspec matchers (RSpec::Mocks::ArgumentMatchers)
* smart error messages for all rspec matchers
* assertions for order of invocations & methods
* support for hooks
